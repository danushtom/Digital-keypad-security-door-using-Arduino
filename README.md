# Digital-keypad-security-door-using-Arduino
Objective:
Often times, we need to secure a room at our home or
office (perhaps a secret dexter ’s laboratory) so that no one can access the room without our permission and ensure protection against theft or loss of our important accessories and assets. There are so many types of security systems present today but behind the scene, for authentication they all relay on fingerprint, retina scanner, iris scanner, face id, tongue scanner, RFID reader, password, pin, patterns, etc. Off all the solutions the low-cost one is to use a password or pin-based system. So, in this project, We have built an Arduino Keypad Door Lock which can be mounted to any of your existing doors to secure them with a digital

password. 
List of components: 

1. Arduino Uno/Pro/Mini or Custom board using Atmega   328p Microcontroller 
2. 16 x 2 LCD (Liquid Crystal Display)
3. 4 x 3 or 4 x 4 matrix keypad for Arduino
4. Servo motor
5. 3D printed door locker/customised door locker
6. Additional components for power supply of 1 Amp 5 Volt mobile charger
7. 4’’ / 6’’plastics boxes, jumper wires, nuts bolts, plastic casing, etc.
